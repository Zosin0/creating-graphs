    <h1>Graph Concepts</h1>
    <p>A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges (also called arcs) connecting these vertices.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> A graph where edges have no direction. The edges are represented by unordered pairs of vertices.</li>
        <li><strong>Directed Graph:</strong> A graph where edges have a direction. The edges are represented by ordered pairs of vertices.</li>
        <li><strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> A graph where edges have weights or costs associated with them.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Graph Representation</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to represent a graph:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong> A 2D array where the value at index (i, j) represents the presence or absence of an edge between vertices i and j.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacency List:</strong> A collection of linked lists or arrays where each list/array represents the neighbors of a vertex.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Graph Traversal</h2>
    <p>Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting all the vertices of a graph. There are two common traversal algorithms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> A traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., visiting all the neighbors of a vertex before moving on to the next level.</li>
        <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> A traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in depth-first order, i.e., visiting a vertex and then recursively visiting all its unvisited neighbors.</li>
    </ul>
